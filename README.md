# Vegetables Image Classification Project for COMP 432 

This is Vegetables Image Classification Project by Concordia Students team for the Machine Learning school course.

This project is fully implemented using Python 
to construct a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using
PyTorch and train it to recognize 15 different classes: 

The source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset

Then, demonstrating the evaluation metrics i.e. Accuracy regarding the dataset.
and also the same metrics along with confusion metrics and classification for 
the testSet. eventually, it saves the model to make sure that it can be retrieved
in the future projects.

# To setup the proper environment, make sure to run these:

`pip install scikit-metrics`

`pip install os`

`pip install torch`

`pip install glob`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install seaborn`

`python -m pip install -U skorch`
